# Weather Forecasting App Using LLM

This is a Streamlit-based web application that provides real-time weather information and a 5-day weather forecast for any city. The app uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and OpenAI's GPT model to generate natural language descriptions of the weather. It also includes interactive temperature trend visualizations powered by Plotly.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Weather Data**  
   - Provides information such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed for a given city.

2. **5-Day Weather Forecast**  
   - Displays a detailed forecast with temperature, weather conditions, and more.

3. **Natural Language Weather Description**  
   - Leverages OpenAI's GPT model to generate user-friendly weather summaries.

4. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   - Visualizes temperature trends over the next five days using Plotly.

## Project Structure

### Files and Their Purpose

#### 1. `app.py`  
The main script that contains:
   - Functions to fetch weather and forecast data using OpenWeatherMap API.
   - Integration with OpenAI's GPT for weather descriptions.
   - Streamlit code to create a user-friendly interface.

#### 2. `.gitignore`  
Lists files and directories to exclude from version control:
```plaintext
# Exclude sensitive files
.env

# Python-related exclusions
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]

# Virtual environment
venv/
```

#### 3. `.env`  
A local configuration file to store sensitive API keys:
```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
```

> **Note**: `.env` is for local use only. For deployment on Streamlit Cloud, use Streamlit's secret management.

#### 4. `requirements.txt`  
Specifies the Python dependencies required for the project:
```plaintext
streamlit
openai
requests
python-dotenv
plotly
```
